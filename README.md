# Google Developer Scholarship with Udacity

## TourGuide 

#### Version 1.0
[TODO: Add Screencast here]
![TourGuide v1.0]()

### Project Overview

This is an app with multiple screens, each of which lists a kind of attraction for a given city, national park, or historical monument. For instance, an app focused on Mountain View, CA might include a list of startup headquarters as well as a list of restaurants and a list of parks.

The main purpose of this project is to showcase knowledge around Fragments, ViewPagers, ListView's, and Adapters.

Also covers bitmap generation and image optimisation.

### Inspiration

A recent trip to Amsterdam where I stumbled across the 'I am Amsterdam' branding. 

One things led to another and I discovered the campaign's [website](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/).

I loved the branding and decided to try to recreate it in an app.

Loving the simplicity of these cards and as you case above I've stolen most of the design ðŸ˜€.

### Why this project?
  
A great way to increase the complexity of the apps I'm building whilst learning best practices like Bitmap generation, image optimisation, performance, and memory management.

### What will I learn?

This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:
* Deep dive into ListViews, ArrayLists, ArrayListAdapters, and custom Java classes
* Building navigation patterns using fragments and fragment adapters

### Extra challenges

* Material Design adherence when it comes to measurements, spacing, color
* Conditional view rendering
* Collapsible AppBar

### Requirements

#### Layout

##### Overall Layout

App contains at least 4 lists of relevant attractions for a location.

##### Navigation

User navigates between lists in Fragments using either a Navigation Drawer or a ViewPager plus TabLayout.

##### List Item Contents

Each list item contains information about an event, restaurant, historical site, or similar.

##### Pictures

At least one list includes pictures of the location.

##### Layout Best Practices

The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
- Text sizes are defined in sp
- Lengths are defined in dp
- Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.

#### Functionality

##### Location Object

App contains a custom object for storing location information .

##### Custom Adapter

App uses a custom adapter to populate the layout with views based on instances of the custom class.

##### String Storage

All strings are stored in the strings.xml resource file.

##### Image Storage

All images are stored as drawables.

All drawables are stored at multiple densities.

##### Errors

The code runs without errors.


#### Code Readability

##### Readability

Code is easily readable so that a fellow programmer can understand the purpose of the app.

##### Naming Conventions

All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named so that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.

##### Formatting

The code is properly formatted:
- No unnecessary blank lines
- No unused variables or methods
- No commented out code
- The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
